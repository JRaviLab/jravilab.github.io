Currently, we prefer students coming in with fellowships/scholarships (e.g., SROP, ENSURE, other department/college-level awards).\nWe are happy to train them in many aspects of data-intensive biology. A keen interest in bioinformatics, computational biology, statistics/biostatistics, computer science, genetics, or related fields, and prior programming experience in R, Python, Perl, and/or C/C++ would be a huge plus. As part of this project, they will have the opportunity to work closely with a senior scientist and learn to: a) work with large datasets, b) write structured, well-documented code to analyze, integrate, and visualize these datasets, c) interpret the results in the context of pathogenesis, and d) communicate the results in the form of a paper and presentation.\nWe have high expectations for their level of commitment to research, and we are keen on incorporating their contributions into co-authored papers in conferences/journals. As an undergraduate student, if you are interested in discussing research opportunities, please send me an email to set up a time to talk.\nGraduate Student Research We are looking for a highly motivated Masters student who is looking to do an internship or a long-term project (6mo–1yr) in developing computational approaches to accelerate drug-/vaccine-target discovery against infectious diseases. You will be a perfect fit if you have a background in bioinformatics, computational biology, statistics/biostatistics, computer science, genetics, or related fields. Having programming experience in R, Python, Perl, and/or C/C++ is a huge plus. In addition to these technical qualifications, we are looking for someone who can work well in a team, work hard, and give/take constructive feedback.\nThis research experience will give you the opportunity to i) use data analysis and visualization to address key biological questions as pertaining to molecular evolution, diagnosis, and treatment (using R), ii) present at group meetings, journals, technical workshops and conferences, iii) develop high coding standards for writing efficient, clear, well-documented, version-controlled code, iv) equip yourself professional for your next career step.\nStart a conversation Please send me your latest CV and a cover letter that includes i) a summary of your academic/work experience, ii) description of relevant coursework, research experience (incl. publications, conference talks/posters), iii) a brief note on familiarity in the field of phylogenetics, molecular evolution, and comparative pathogenomics, iv) coding experience, if any.

Here we reconstruct the complete sigma factor regulatory network of the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis by an integrated approach. The approach combines identification of direct regulatory interactions between M. tuberculosis sigma factors in an E. coli model system, validation of selected links in M. tuberculosis, and extensive literature review. The resulting network comprises 41 direct interactions among all 13 sigma factors. Analysis of network topology reveals (i) a three-tiered hierarchy initiating at master regulators, (ii) high connectivity and (iii) distinct communities containing multiple sigma factors. These topological features are likely associated with multi-layer signal processing and specialized stress responses involving multiple sigma factors. Moreover, the identification of overrepresented network motifs, such as autoregulation and coregulation of sigma and anti-sigma factor pairs, provides structural information that is relevant for studies of network dynamics.","tags":["stress-response","compbio-bioinfo","host/pathogen","R"],"title":"Reconstruction and topological characterization of the sigma factor regulatory network of Mycobacterium tuberculosis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pratik Datta","Janani Ravi","Valentina Guerrini","Rinki Chauhan","Matt B Neiditch","Scarlet S Shell","Sarah M Fortune","Baris Hancioglu","Oleg A Igoshin","Maria L Gennaro"],"categories":["Research"],"content":"","date":1438560000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1438560000,"objectID":"383669789a11e46e90f65202d4ebff3d","permalink":"/publication/psp-mtb/","publishdate":"2015-08-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/psp-mtb/","section":"publication","summary":"The bacterial envelope integrates essential stress-sensing and adaptive functions; thus, envelope-preserving functions are important for survival. In Gram-negative bacteria, envelope integrity during stress is maintained by the multi-gene Psp response. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was thought to lack the Psp system since it encodes only pspA and no other psp ortholog. Intriguingly, pspA maps downstream from clgR, which encodes a transcription factor regulated by the MprAB-σ(E) envelope-stress-signaling system. clgR inactivation lowered ATP concentration during stress and protonophore treatment-induced clgR-pspA expression, suggesting that these genes express Psp-like functions. We identified a four-gene set - clgR, pspA (rv2744c), rv2743c, rv2742c - that is regulated by clgR and in turn regulates ClgR activity. Regulatory and protein-protein interactions within the set and a requirement of the four genes for functions associated with envelope integrity and surface-stress tolerance indicate that a Psp-like system has evolved in mycobacteria. Among Actinobacteria, the four-gene module occurred only in tuberculous mycobacteria and was required for intramacrophage growth, suggesting links between its function and mycobacterial virulence. Additionally, the four-gene module was required for MprAB-σ(E) stress-signaling activity. The positive feedback between envelope-stress-sensing and envelope-preserving functions allows sustained responses to multiple, envelope-perturbing signals during chronic infection, making the system uniquely suited to tuberculosis pathogenesis.","tags":["stress-response","phylogeny-evolution","host/pathogen","compbio-bioinfo","R"],"title":"The Psp system of Mycobacterium tuberculosis integrates envelope stress-sensing and envelope-preserving functions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hugh Salamon","Natalie Bruiners","Karim Lakehal","Lanbo Shi","Janani Ravi","Ken D Yamaguchi","Richard Pine","Maria L Gennaro"],"categories":["Research"],"content":"","date":1404187200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1404187200,"objectID":"605cb9dc5a1258eccc8208939236204d","permalink":"/publication/jimm/","publishdate":"2014-07-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/jimm/","section":"publication","summary":" ","tags":["compbio-bioinfo","host/pathogen"],"title":"Cutting edge: Vitamin D regulates lipid metabolism in Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection","type":"publication"}]
