## *Welcome to our new chapter!*

## What we're about
*R-Ladies East Lansing* is a local chapter of R-Ladies Global. We meet to discuss, learn, teach, present, work on all things R! Our priority is to provide a safe community space for anyone identifying as a minority gender who is interested in and/or working with R. The group exists to promote gender diversity in the R community worldwide. We are pro-actively inclusive of queer, trans, and all minority identities, with additional sensitivity to intersectional identities.

## Who should join?
R-Ladies East Lansing welcomes members of **all R proficiency levels**, whether you are a new or aspiring R user, or an experienced R programmer interested in mentoring, networking & expert upskilling. Our non-profit, civil society community is designed to develop our members' R skills & knowledge through social, collaborative learning & sharing. *Supporting minority identity access to STEM skills & careers, the Free Software Movement, and contributing to the global R community!*

*Anyone and everyone interested in R/Data Science* should join our group and participate/contribute in any way you can, be they learners, teachers, developers or innovators! We encourage women and minority genders to present/lead most sessions, conversations but we have *no restrictions* whatsoever when it comes to membership, participation, and discussions. So, please join us and bring your R-family & R-friends!
