&lt;p>We are developing an integrated computational evolutionary framework that will bring together: 1) molecular evolution and phylogeny; and 2) comparative genomics/pangenomics to study any pathogen-group or protein family, and discover distinctive protein/genomic features relevant to biological comparisons of interest (such as identifying diagnostic or candidate vaccine targets in emerging, poorly characterized pathogens).&lt;/p>
