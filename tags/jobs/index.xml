&lt;h2 id=&#34;postdoctoral-researcher&#34;&gt;Postdoctoral Researcher&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are looking for a talented and motivated individual to join the JRaviLab (PI: Dr. Janani Ravi) at the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/ai&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Center for Health AI&lt;/a&gt;, University of Colorado, Anschutz Medical Campus as a postdoctoral researcher. In our group, we develop/apply computational approaches to analyze and visualize multiscale biological data to study microbial phenotypes and diseases, including genomes, protein sequence-structural features, transcriptomes, and pathway memberships.
Postdocs will contribute to this vision by 1) developing new computational approaches to analyze and integrate large collections of biological data, 2) applying these approaches to specific problems in microbiology and infectious diseases, and 3) communicating the methods and discoveries openly to the broader biomedical/clinical community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to participating in ongoing projects, we strongly encourage postdocs to come up with several research ideas, jointly develop them into creative projects, and lead the way in those new directions. We encourage postdocs to apply for federal/foundational fellowships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are committed to building a diverse team and sustaining an inclusive and supportive environment; we strongly encourage underrepresented minorities in STEM to apply, including but not limited to BIPOC and LGBTQIA+ folks. The position is open to international applicants, in addition to US citizens/permanent residents.&lt;/p&gt;
