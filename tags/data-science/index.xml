&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I will remember that I didn’t make the world, and it doesn’t satisfy my equations.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Though I will use models boldly to estimate value, I will not be overly impressed by mathematics.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I will never sacrifice reality for elegance without explaining why I have done so.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nor will I give the people who use my model false comfort about its accuracy. Instead, I will make explicit its assumptions and oversights.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I understand that my work may have enormous effects on society and the economy, many of them beyond my comprehension.
