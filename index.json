Pathogens acquire AMR much faster than we discover new drugs, warranting new methods to better understand the molecular underpinnings of AMR. Traditional approaches for detecting AMR in novel bacterial strains are time-consuming and labor-intensive. However, advances in sequencing technology offer a plethora of bacterial genome data, and computational approaches like machine learning (ML) provide an optimistic scope for in silico AMR prediction. Here, we introduce a comprehensive multiscale ML approach to predict AMR phenotypes and identify AMR molecular features associated with a single drug or drug family, stratified by time and geographical locations. As a case study, we focus on a subset of the World Health Organization’s Bacterial Priority Pathogens, frequently drug-resistant and nosocomial bacteria: Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and two Enterobacter species. We started with sequenced genomes with lab-derived AMR phenotypes, constructed pangenomes, clustered protein sequences, and extracted protein domains to generate pangenomic features across molecular scales. To uncover the molecular mechanisms behind drug-/drug family-specific resistance, we trained logistic regression ML models on our datasets. These yielded ranked lists of AMR-associated genes, proteins, and domains. In addition to recapitulating known AMR features, our models identified novel candidates for experimental validation. They performed well across molecular scales, data types (binary vs. counts), and drugs. The models achieved a median normalized Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.89, suggesting robust performance across molecular scales with counts or presence/absence of features. Model performance showed resilience even when evaluated on geographical and temporal holdouts. Our holistic approach promises reliable prediction of existing and developing resistance in newly sequenced pathogen genomes, along with the mechanistic molecular contributors of AMR.","tags":["antimicrobial-resistance","pathogenic-features","molecular-evolution","machine-learning","webapp","compbio-bioinfo"],"title":"From sequence to signature: Uncovering multiscale AMR features across bacterial pathogens with supervised machine learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kewalin Samart","Ling Thang","Landon Buskirk","Amy Tonielli","Arjun Krishnan","Janani Ravi"],"categories":["Research"],"content":"AK and JR are co-corresponding authors.\n","date":1748822400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1748822400,"objectID":"437d0e2da3c05a571ecd3d7e0f2ba054","permalink":"/publication/drugrep_tb/","publishdate":"2025-06-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/drugrep_tb/","section":"publication","summary":"Tuberculosis (TB) remains the second leading cause of infectious disease mortality worldwide, killing over one million people annually. Rising antibiotic resistance has created an urgent need for host-directed therapeutics (HDTs) — preferably by repurposing existing approved drugs — that modulate host immune responses rather than directly targeting the pathogen. Repurposed therapeutics have been successfully identified for cancer and COVID-19 by finding drugs that reverse disease gene expression patterns (an approach called ‘connectivity scoring’), but this approach remains largely unexplored for bacterial infections like TB. The application of transcriptome-based methods to TB faces significant challenges, including dataset heterogeneity across transcriptomics platforms and biological conditions, uncertainty about optimal scoring methods, and lack of systematic approaches to identify robust disease signatures. Here, we developed an integrative computational workflow combining multiple connectivity scoring methods with consensus disease signature construction and used it to systematically identify FDA-approved drugs as promising TB host-directed therapeutics. Our framework integrates six complementary connectivity methods and constructs weighted consensus signatures from 21 TB gene expression datasets spanning microarray and RNA-seq platforms, diverse cell types, and infection conditions. Our approach prioritized 140 high-confidence drug candidates that consistently reverse TB-associated gene expression changes, successfully recovering known HDTs, including statins (atorvastatin, lovastatin, fluvastatin) and vitamin D receptor agonists (calcitriol). We identified promising novel candidates such as niclosamide and tamoxifen, both recently validated in experimental TB models, and revealed enrichment for therapeutically relevant mechanisms, e.g., cholesterol metabolism inhibition and immune modulation pathways. Network analysis of disease-drug interactions identified 10 key bridging genes (including MYD88, RELA, and CXCR2) that represent potential novel druggable targets for TB host-directed therapy. This work establishes transcriptome-based connectivity mapping as a viable approach for systematic HDT discovery in bacterial infections and provides a robust computational framework applicable to other infectious diseases. Our findings offer immediate opportunities for experimental validation of prioritized drug candidates and mechanistic investigation of identified druggable targets in TB pathogenesis.","tags":["host-response","drug-repurposing","disease-signature","compbio-bioinfo"],"title":"Integrative transcriptome-based drug repurposing in tuberculosis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Abhirupa Ghosh","Charmie Vang","Evan Brenner","Janani Ravi"],"categories":["Research"],"content":"","date":1748217600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1748217600,"objectID":"b4dfb3a441c13eea87140c197e8273a1","permalink":"/publication/amr_tim/","publishdate":"2025-05-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/amr_tim/","section":"publication","summary":"The global antimicrobial resistance (AMR) emergency is driven by complex and evolving molecular mechanisms.

The budding yeast cell cycle is also one of the best-studied dynamical systems owing to its thoroughly resolved genetics. However, the dynamics underlying the crucial cell cycle decision point called the START transition, at which the cell commits to a new round of DNA replication and cell division, are under-studied. The START machinery involves a central cyclin-dependent kinase; cyclins responsible for starting the transition, bud formation, and initiating DNA synthesis; and their transcriptional regulators. However, evidence has shown that the mechanism is more complicated than a simple irreversible transition switch. Activating a key transcription regulator SBF requires the phosphorylation of its inhibitor, Whi5, or an SBF/MBF monomeric component, Swi6, but not necessarily both. Also, the timing and mechanism of the inhibitor Whi5's nuclear export, while important, are not critical for the timing and execution of START. Therefore, there is a need for a consolidated model for the budding yeast START transition, reconciling regulatory and spatial dynamics. We built a detailed mathematical model (START-BYCC) for the START transition in the budding yeast cell cycle based on established molecular interactions and experimental phenotypes. START-BYCC recapitulates the underlying dynamics and correctly emulates key phenotypic traits of ~150 known START mutants, including regulation of size control, localization of inhibitor/transcription factor complexes, and the nutritional effects on size control. Such a detailed mechanistic understanding of the underlying dynamics gets us closer towards deconvoluting the aberrant cellular development in cancer.","tags":["tbd",null],"title":"Modeling the START transition in the budding yeast cell cycle","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Janani Ravi","Vivek Anantharaman","Samuel Chen","Evan Brenner","Pratik Datta","L Aravind","Maria Gennaro"],"categories":["Research"],"content":"JR, LA, and MG are co-corresponding authors.\n","date":1716940800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1716940800,"objectID":"fc18d224593f709f27d89922b39dfdfc","permalink":"/publication/psp_evolution/","publishdate":"2020-09-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/psp_evolution/","section":"publication","summary":"Bacterial phage shock protein (PSP) systems stabilize the bacterial cell membrane and protect against envelope stress.

This approach underscored the evolutionary significance of the system, revealing that its core protein PspA (Snf7 in ESCRT outside bacteria) was present in the last universal common ancestor and that this ancestral functionality has since diversified into multiple novel, distinct PSP systems across life. Several novel partners of the PSP system were identified: (i) the Toastrack domain, likely facilitating assembly of sub-membrane stress-sensing and signaling complexes, (ii) the newly defined HTH-associated α-helical signaling domain-PadR-like transcriptional regulator pair system, and (iii) multiple independent associations with ATPase, CesT/Tir-like chaperone, and Band-7 domains in proteins thought to mediate sub-membrane dynamics.

Prior studies indicated that the human pathogen, Staphylococcus aureus utilizes glutathione (GSH) as a source of nutrient sulfur; however, mechanisms of GSH acquisition are not defined. Here, we identify a previously uncharacterized five-gene locus comprising a putative ABC-transporter and γ–glutamyl transpeptidase (ggt) that promotes S. aureus proliferation in medium supplemented with either reduced or oxidized GSH (GSSG) as the sole source of nutrient sulfur. Based on these phenotypes, we name this transporter the Glutathione import system (GisABCD). We confirm that Ggt is capable of cleaving GSH and GSSG γ–bonds and that this process is required for their use as nutrient sulfur sources. Additionally, we find that the enzyme is cell associated. Bioinformatic analyses reveal that only Staphylococcus species closely related to S. aureus encode GisABCD-Ggt homologues. Homologues are not detected in Staphylococcus epidermidis. Consequently, we establish that GisABCD-Ggt provides a competitive advantage for S. aureus over S. epidermidis in a GSH-dependent manner. Overall, this study describes the discovery of a nutrient sulfur acquisition system in S. aureus that targets GSH and promotes competition against other staphylococci commonly associated with the human microbiota.","tags":["nutrient-acquisition","pathogenic-features","host/pathogen","molecular-evolution","phylogeny","staphylococcus","compbio-bioinfo"],"title":"The glutathione import system satisfies the Staphylococcus aureus nutrient sulfur requirement and promotes interspecies competition","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Janani Ravi"],"categories":["Research","R"],"content":"Workshop material: https://github.com/jraviLab/2023-glbio\nHosted w/ Jake Krol, Faisal Alquaddoomi\n","date":1684155600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1684155600,"objectID":"ef7890d4b18e0ccaa5b5b7075ae20887","permalink":"/talk/2023-glbio/","publishdate":"2023-05-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2023-glbio/","section":"talk","summary":"We recently developed a web application, MolEvolvR, to characterize proteins using molecular evolution and phylogeny.

Previous studies aimed at delineating the mechanisms behind placental colonization of L. monocytogenes identified a key virulence factor, internalin P (InlP). The internalin family of proteins has been studied extensively due to their conservation in the genus Listeria and their contribution to virulence and pathogenicity in L. monocytogenes. Still, many questions remain regarding the evolution of internalins and their potential roles in non-pathogenic Listeria. Our work addresses this gap in knowledge by (1) identifying additional InlP homologs in Listeria, including L. ivanovii, L. seeligeri, L. innocua, and L. costaricensis, and (2) characterizing these homologs using computational evolutionary methods to compare their primary sequences, domain architectures, and structural models. Together, our findings contribute to the field by providing insights into the evolution of one key member of the internalin family, as well as serving as a catalyst for future studies of InlP and its role in Listeria pathogenesis.","tags":["internalins","pathogenic-features","host/pathogen","molecular-evolution","phylogeny","listeria","compbio-bioinfo"],"title":"Novel Internalin P homologs in Listeria ivanovii londoniensis and Listeria seeligeri","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Janani Ravi"],"categories":["Research","R"],"content":"","date":1657806300,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1657806300,"objectID":"6d61bc2a6ec78583439127fc8aa7c8f8","permalink":"/talk/2022-ismb/","publishdate":"2022-07-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2022-ismb/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["phylogeny","molecular-evolution","pathogenic-features","compbio-bioinfo","amr","comparative-genomics","software-tools"],"title":"Cross-database integration using evolution and machine learning to identify multiscale molecular building blocks for antibiotic resistance","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Janani Ravi"],"categories":["R","Resources"],"content":"","date":1653768e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653768e3,"objectID":"386aaea37afaf8f97ce6a11feb38a77d","permalink":"/talk/2022-iscb_academy/","publishdate":"2022-05-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2022-iscb_academy/","section":"talk","summary":"This workshop presents how to analyze \u0026 visualize processed transcriptomic data.\n\nThis workshop is divided in 5 parts:\nPart 1: Getting started w/ `readr`\nPart 2: Reshaping data w/ `tidyr`\nPart 3: Data wrangling w/ `dplyr`\nPart 4: Visualizing tidy data w/ `ggplot`\nPart 5: Export and Wrap-up w/ `rmarkdown`\n\nBy the end of this workshop, you will be able to load your transcriptomic dataset, perform basic data tidying \u0026 wrangling, data visualization, and save/export your results using tidyverse!

This principle was defined and popularized by the influential 'connectivity map' study in 2006 regarding reversal relationships between disease- and drug-induced gene expression profiles, quantified by a disease-drug 'connectivity score.' Over the past 15 years, several studies have proposed variations in calculating connectivity scores toward improving accuracy and robustness in light of massive growth in reference drug profiles. However, these variations have been formulated inconsistently using various notations and terminologies even though they are based on a common set of conceptual and statistical ideas. Therefore, we present a systematic reconciliation of multiple disease-drug similarity metrics ($ES$, $css$, $Sum$, $Cosine$, $XSum$, $XCor$, $XSpe$, $XCos$, $EWCos$) and connectivity scores ($CS$, $RGES$, $NCS$, $WCS$, $Tau$, $CSS$, $EMUDRA$) by defining them using consistent notation and terminology. In addition to providing clarity and deeper insights, this coherent definition of connectivity scores and their relationships provides a unified scheme that newer methods can adopt, enabling the computational drug-development community to compare and investigate different approaches easily. To facilitate the continuous and transparent integration of newer methods, this article will be available as a live document (https://jravilab.github.io/connectivity_scores) coupled with a GitHub repository (https://github.com/jravilab/connectivity_scores) that any researcher can build on and push changes to.","tags":["host-response","drug-repurposing","disease-signature","compbio-bioinfo"],"title":"Reconciling Multiple Connectivity Scores for Drug Repurposing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Janani Ravi"],"categories":["R","Resources"],"content":"","date":1635969600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635969600,"objectID":"742902875c1790ec4ee2ad8c1fb3b1e9","permalink":"/talk/2021-bioc_asia/","publishdate":"2021-11-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2021-bioc_asia/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["R","data-science","community","inclusion","AsiaR"],"title":"Strategies to build a strong diverse AsiaR community","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Janani Ravi"],"categories":["Research","R"],"content":"","date":1627416e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627416e3,"objectID":"0a6e38f1dd40f11177de2f5e1fd801e1","permalink":"/talk/2021-ismb/","publishdate":"2021-07-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2021-ismb/","section":"talk","summary":"Studying how bacterial pathogenic proteins evolve can help identify lineage-specific and pathogen-specific signatures and variants, and consequently, their functions.

Moreover, delineating this history of proteins is best done at all three levels, sequence, structure, and function, and comparative pangenomics. However, currently, there are no unified frameworks that experimentalists can avail to seamlessly perform all these analyses for their proteins of their interest. Using these software/tools requires numerous skills/resources: install individual tools; download/preprocess massive datasets; match disparate input-output data formats across different tools; computational resources for efficient analyses; computational know-how to run command-line tools; intuitive result summarization and visualization.\nApproach: To address this challenge, we have developed a computational framework for comprehensive evolutionary analysis that systematically integrates multiple data sources for gleaning sequence-structure-function relationships. Our framework goes beyond simple sequence comparisons by delving into constituent domains, domain architectures, phyletic spreads, and tracing the evolution across the tree of life. By adding a critical step of comparative pangenomics to these analyses, we can pinpoint molecular and genomic features that are unique to bacterial groups of interest (e.g., specific pathogens), which can then help prioritize candidate molecular targets, even in poorly characterized bacterial genomes.\nResults: We have developed a computational approach for molecular evolution and phylogeny that researchers can perform homology searches across the tree of life and reconstructs domain architecture by characterizing the input proteins and each of their homologs by combining: sequence alignment and clustering algorithms for domain detection; profile matching against protein domain/orthology databases; and prediction algorithms for signal peptides, transmembrane regions, cellular localization, and secondary/tertiary structures. We are adding an additional layer of comparative pangenomics to identify unique features for bacterial groups of interest (e.g., pathogens vs nonpathogens). An instance of the web-app, applied to study a large number of Psp stress response proteins (present across the tree of life) can be found here: jravilab.shinyapps.io/psp-evolution. The web-app described here is a general web-server that researchers can use to study any protein(s) of interest. To demonstrate the versatility of this framework, we are currently applying it to zoonotic pathogens causing severe and chronic pathologies in humans and animals, for e.g., host-specific factors in Nontuberculous Mycobacteria, nutrient acquisition systems in Staphylococcus aureus, and surface layer proteins in Bacillus anthracis. We have implemented this computational approach for molecular evolution and phylogeny (MolEvolvR) as open-source software (R-package) and a streamlined easy-to-use web application (jraviilab.org/molevolvr) that will enable us and other researchers to prioritize candidate genetic factors in their application of interest for experimental validation.\n","tags":["compbio-bioinfo","molecular-evolution","pathogenic-features","phylogeny","stress-response","comparative-genomics"],"title":"Using a computational molecular evolution and phylogeny to study pathogenic proteins","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Janani Ravi"],"categories":["R","Resources"],"content":"","date":1620590400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1620590400,"objectID":"06a45fb67b5020e2da3b75b8e416bd0b","permalink":"/talk/2021-rlpune/","publishdate":"2021-05-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2021-rlpune/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["R","data-science","community","inclusion","rladies"],"title":"Making cool publication quality tables w/ R","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Janani Ravi","Sara Mortara","Jonelle Villar","Haifa Ben Messaoud","Beatriz Milz","Zulemma Bazurto Blacio"],"categories":["R","Resources"],"content":"","date":161964e4,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":161964e4,"objectID":"c63ebd052a3568d111c76f34e15722df","permalink":"/talk/2021-rladies_user/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2021-rladies_user/","section":"talk","summary":"This year useR!

Starting with Daniel Kahneman’s Thinking Fast and Slow, followed by the writings and blogs of Steven Levitt, Dan Ariely, Nate Silver and Barry Schwartz (and still others like Malcolm Gladwell), has set me thinking a lot about how insane and illogical we are. We do see ourselves as logical and reasonably intelligent people who do not fall for the usual traps (OK, maybe you didn’t see me that way, but we’ll let that slide for now…), but how fool-proof are we? What about the narrative fallacy - ‘aah, that makes sense now’ or ‘I thought so’ or confirmation biases?\n‘The Black Swan’ by Nassim Nicholas Taleb (http://fooledbyrandomness.com/) has been on my list ever since I first got infatuated with this topic. I finally finished it last month. Man, is it it well-written! The guy is brilliant, and his wit and humor are unmatchable! Among other things, he leads (and concludes) with our love for everything normal, statistically speaking and otherwise, and how we can’t but help make the obvious blunders of predicting, quite erroneously, based on the past, even though we know fully well that life doesn’t present itself as a series of bell curves stringed together just so that we can get away with some easy math! You’ll hear a lot about epistemology (defined in PS3; truth be told, I hadn’t heard of this word until last month), mediocristan (the Gaussian life) vs extremistan (scale-free distributions encountered more often than not in real-life)\nHere’s a snippet: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7_wAV4HsNrkQmdFMndHSHhldFE/view Never mind if you don’t get it. I enjoyed every last bit of the book, and hope that you do too! Give it a try - whether you love it or hate it, it would be time well-spent! :)\nHappy reading!\nPS1. I’ve heard that people either love it or hate it. Clearly, I fall in the bin #1. Do I agree with everything? Well, yeah, almost everything. PS2. Luckily, none of you are directly tied to economics or financial sectors. :D Well, scientists and statisticians have been insulted too, but the elegance of it makes it OK! Lots to think about.:) PS3. Epistemology studies the nature of knowledge, justification, and the rationality of belief. Much of the debate in epistemology centers on four areas: (1) the philosophical analysis of the nature of knowledge and how it relates to such concepts as truth, belief, and justification, (2) various problems of skepticism, (3) the sources and scope of knowledge and justified belief, and (4) the criteria for knowledge and justification.\nTags #behavioraleconomics #books #suggestions #mustread #randomness #economics #business #philosophy\nblurb, review, snapshot below\nBlurb A black swan is a highly improbable event with three principal characteristics: It is unpredictable; it carries a massive impact; and, after the fact, we concoct an explanation that makes it appear less random, and more predictable, than it was.\nThe astonishing success of Google was a black swan; so was 9/11. For Nassim Nicholas Taleb, black swans underlie almost everything about our world, from the rise of religions to events in our own personal lives.\nWhy do we not acknowledge the phenomenon of black swans until after they occur? Part of the answer, according to Taleb, is that humans are hardwired to learn specifics when they should be focused on generalities.\nWe concentrate on things we already know and time and time again fail to take into consideration what we don’t know. We are, therefore, unable to truly estimate opportunities, too vulnerable to the impulse to simplify, narrate, and categorize, and not open enough to rewarding those who can imagine the “impossible.”\nFor years, Taleb has studied how we fool ourselves into thinking we know more than we actually do. We restrict our thinking to the irrelevant and inconsequential, while large events continue to surprise us and shape our world. Now, in this revelatory book, Taleb explains everything we know about what we don’t know. He offers surprisingly simple tricks for dealing with black swans and benefiting from them.\nElegant, startling, and universal in its applications ‘The Black Swan’ will change the way you look at the world. Taleb is a vastly entertaining writer, with wit, irreverence, and unusual stories to tell. He has a polymathic command of subjects ranging from cognitive science to business to probability theory.\n‘The Black Swan’ is a landmark book – itself a black swan.\n","date":1493164800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1493164800,"objectID":"8b40a96d92f81a37e1ff06d49df422fa","permalink":"/post/black-swan-nassim-taleb/","publishdate":"2017-04-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/black-swan-nassim-taleb/","section":"post","summary":"Brief book review/book recommendation.","tags":["books"],"title":"Black Swan by Nassim Taleb","type":"post"},{"authors":["Janani Ravi","Vivek Anantharaman","L Aravind Iyer","Maria L Gennaro"],"categories":["Research"],"content":"","date":1491238800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1491238800,"objectID":"a7e54386f219201ea221cf704105e281","permalink":"/talk/2017-asm-tb/","publishdate":"2017-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2017-asm-tb/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["phylogeny-evolution","compbio-bioinfo"],"title":"Evolution and Conservation of the Psp Envelope Stress-Response System","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Resources"],"content":" Why I’m writing this The initial process, where you read and imbibe!

My closest consulate was the one in New York (CGNY). I am originally from Chennai, Tamil Nadu (India). So, most of the state department and RPO/police verification guidelines I’ve enlisted below worked for my specific case. Folks from other countries can skip ahead from their consulate to the last step reading some country-specific blogs in-between.\nThe initial process, where you read and imbibe!

Mine was Tamil Nadu. Other useful PDFs that may include some of the above: The_process Approximate order of key events \u0026amp; things-to-do Read \u0026amp; decipher the resources. It’s a one-time thing. So, do it! Start at least 1–1.5yrs before your current employment ends/your extended J1 expires. The process takes time \u0026amp; patience. Give time for ‘worst case scenarios’! Tip: Talk to your department admin and your university’s international/J1 office. Note: First extend your J1 \u0026amp; then apply for the waiver. You can’t extend once you apply for your waiver. Notarization of your biodata and affidavit (your local bank or other notary publics) Attestation of your biodata and affidavit: Local Indian consulate with the necessary documents Some require passport-sized photo taken within the last 6 mo (CGNY did ‘require’ but they didn’t ’need’ it!!) Call to get their full list and check their website before going Send your packages to the 3 departments back home (web portal/postal mail w/ tracking) Back to the local Indian consulate Take your 3 NORIs and forms to get a NORI that they will forward to the Department of State, US) Send your package to USCIS (w/ tracking) Include all the necessary background documents NORIs from all of the above DS-3035 form Preferably, don’t include what’s not in the govt. list Note: You can migrate your J1 to a different university during your J1’s duration of validity. Talk to both the universities’ J1 departments. This would take 24-48h but can only happen before you terminate your current appointment.

Here we reconstruct the complete sigma factor regulatory network of the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis by an integrated approach. The approach combines identification of direct regulatory interactions between M. tuberculosis sigma factors in an E. coli model system, validation of selected links in M. tuberculosis, and extensive literature review. The resulting network comprises 41 direct interactions among all 13 sigma factors. Analysis of network topology reveals (i) a three-tiered hierarchy initiating at master regulators, (ii) high connectivity and (iii) distinct communities containing multiple sigma factors. These topological features are likely associated with multi-layer signal processing and specialized stress responses involving multiple sigma factors. Moreover, the identification of overrepresented network motifs, such as autoregulation and coregulation of sigma and anti-sigma factor pairs, provides structural information that is relevant for studies of network dynamics.","tags":["stress-response","mycobacteria","network","compbio-bioinfo","host/pathogen","R"],"title":"Reconstruction and topological characterization of the sigma factor regulatory network of Mycobacterium tuberculosis","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Research"],"content":"Summary Leveraging non-infectious disease and drug perturbation transcriptomes to characterize host-response to infection and prioritize host-directed interventions.\nTeam Students Kewalin Samart (MSU) Alumni Phoebe Tuyishime (MSU, UBC) Collaborators Arjun Krishnan (MSU) ","date":145152e4,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":145152e4,"objectID":"3882814436694d859783c078ae4d3571","permalink":"/project/host-response/","publishdate":"2015-12-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/host-response/","section":"project","summary":"Characterizing host response to infection and host-directed interventions","tags":["host-response","drug-repurposing","disease-signature","host-directed-intervention","tb","mycobacteria","staphylococci","ongoing","compbio-bioinfo"],"title":"Host-responses to infection","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Research"],"content":"Summary We also studied host responses to M. tuberculosis infection using computational approaches:\ncharacterizing the transcriptional response in infected macrophages under various small molecule perturbations using RNA-Seq analysis; understanding the dysregulation of lipid metabolism in M. tuberculosis-infected macrophages using dynamic Bayesian model and statistical analyses of heterogeneous single-cell populations.

In Gram-negative bacteria, envelope integrity during stress is maintained by the multi-gene Psp response. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was thought to lack the Psp system since it encodes only pspA and no other psp ortholog. Intriguingly, pspA maps downstream from clgR, which encodes a transcription factor regulated by the MprAB-σ(E) envelope-stress-signaling system. clgR inactivation lowered ATP concentration during stress and protonophore treatment-induced clgR-pspA expression, suggesting that these genes express Psp-like functions. We identified a four-gene set - clgR, pspA (rv2744c), rv2743c, rv2742c - that is regulated by clgR and in turn regulates ClgR activity. Regulatory and protein-protein interactions within the set and a requirement of the four genes for functions associated with envelope integrity and surface-stress tolerance indicate that a Psp-like system has evolved in mycobacteria. Among Actinobacteria, the four-gene module occurred only in tuberculous mycobacteria and was required for intramacrophage growth, suggesting links between its function and mycobacterial virulence. Additionally, the four-gene module was required for MprAB-σ(E) stress-signaling activity. The positive feedback between envelope-stress-sensing and envelope-preserving functions allows sustained responses to multiple, envelope-perturbing signals during chronic infection, making the system uniquely suited to tuberculosis pathogenesis.","tags":["stress-response","phylogeny","molecular-evolution","host/pathogen","mycobacteria","tb","compbio-bioinfo","R"],"title":"The Psp system of Mycobacterium tuberculosis integrates envelope stress-sensing and envelope-preserving functions","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Research"],"content":"","date":1414760400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1414760400,"objectID":"f6b4f57dd933a921edaddda1e9ecd788","permalink":"/talk/2014-imsc/","publishdate":"2014-10-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2014-imsc/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["math-modeling"],"title":"Mathematical modeling of pathways involved in cell cycle regulation and Differentiation","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Hugh Salamon","Natalie Bruiners","Karim Lakehal","Lanbo Shi","Janani Ravi","Ken D Yamaguchi","Richard Pine","Maria L Gennaro"],"categories":["Research"],"content":"","date":1404172800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1404172800,"objectID":"605cb9dc5a1258eccc8208939236204d","permalink":"/publication/jimm/","publishdate":"2014-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jimm/","section":"publication","summary":" ","tags":["tb","transcriptomics","host-response","compbio-bioinfo","host/pathogen"],"title":"Cutting edge: Vitamin D regulates lipid metabolism in Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Research"],"content":"Research During my graduate research with Dr John Tyson, I built mathematical models to understand dynamical aspects:\nModeling the START transition in the budding yeast cell cycle:\nBuilt a detailed mathematical model (~100 ODEs, ~150 parameters) for the START transition in yeast and integrated it with our published model of the whole cell cycle. Model addresses outstanding issues related to the precise mechanism and timing of transcriptional, post-translational and localization events, as well as size control under varying growth conditions. Model consistent with ~200 experimental mutant phenotypes pertaining to the START transition and rest of the cell cycle. Built a basic model for the nutritional effect of size control in budding yeast cells. This mechanism has been incorporated into the existing model of the yeast cell cycle to explain an initial set of START mutants. Modeling bistability in the canonical Wnt pathway:\nBuilt a simplified model based upon the core module of the Wnt canonical pathway, and incorporated additional key regulatory interactions.
