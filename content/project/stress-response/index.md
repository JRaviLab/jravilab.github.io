## Summary
I started working on Bacterial Stress responses during my postdoctoral research at Rutgers University, I continue to focus on using computational evolutionary approaches to study various facets of pathogen biology including:

* delineating the molecular mechanism underlying a newly identified stress response operon in the tubercle bacterium involving the phage-shock-proteins (psp);
* unraveling the evolution of bacterial stress response systems (psp) across the tree of life using protein sequence-structure-function relationships;
* reconstructing and analyzing the mycobacterial sigma factor regulatory network.
