## Summary
We also studied host responses to *M. tuberculosis* infection using computational approaches:

* characterizing the transcriptional response in infected macrophages under various small molecule perturbations using RNA-Seq analysis;
* understanding the dysregulation of lipid metabolism in M. tuberculosis-infected macrophages using dynamic Bayesian model and statistical analyses of heterogeneous single-cell populations.
