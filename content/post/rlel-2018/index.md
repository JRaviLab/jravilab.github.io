Thanks to everyone who attended, participated or sponsored [R-Ladies East Lansing](https://rladies-eastlansing.github.io) in 2018! We had a fantastic start & a very successful first 6mo [on campus](http://bit.ly/rlel-venue)! We hosted 7 meetups since July 2018 including two very well-attended workshops (70+ attendees) and a DataViz challenge! Help us continue spreading the R & Data Science spirit across MSU in 2019! Contact us [eastlansing@rladies.org](mailto:eastlansing@rladies.org) about co-hosting or sponsoring a meetup/workshop in Spring 2019.
