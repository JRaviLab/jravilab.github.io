<div id="what-were-about" class="section level2">
<h2>What we’re about</h2>
<p><em>R-Ladies East Lansing</em> is a local chapter of R-Ladies Global. We meet to discuss, learn, teach, present, work on all things R! Our priority is to provide a safe community space for anyone identifying as a minority gender who is interested in and/or working with R. The group exists to promote gender diversity in the R community worldwide. We are pro-actively inclusive of queer, trans, and all minority identities, with additional sensitivity to intersectional identities.</p>

<h2>Who should join?</h2>
<p>R-Ladies East Lansing welcomes members of <strong>all R proficiency levels</strong>, whether you are a new or aspiring R user, or an experienced R programmer interested in mentoring, networking &amp; expert upskilling. Our non-profit, civil society community is designed to develop our members’ R skills &amp; knowledge through social, collaborative learning &amp; sharing. <em>Supporting minority identity access to STEM skills &amp; careers, the Free Software Movement, and contributing to the global R community!</em></p>
<p><em>Anyone and everyone interested in R/Data Science</em> should join our group and participate/contribute in any way you can, be they learners, teachers, developers or innovators! We encourage women and minority genders to present/lead most sessions, conversations but we have <em>no restrictions</em> whatsoever when it comes to membership, participation, and discussions. So, please join us and bring your R-family &amp; R-friends!</p>
