I recently came across the **Modeler's Hippocratic Oath** while reading [Cathy O'Neil's](//twitter.com/mathbabedotorg) 'Weapons of Math Destruction'.

This was originally written by [Emanuel Derman](//twitter.com/EmanuelDerman) and [Paul Wilmott](//twitter.com/wilmott) in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.

## The Oath
* I will remember that I didn’t make the world, and it doesn’t satisfy my equations.
* Though I will use models boldly to estimate value, I will not be overly impressed by mathematics.
* I will never sacrifice reality for elegance without explaining why I have done so.
* Nor will I give the people who use my model false comfort about its accuracy. Instead, I will make explicit its assumptions and oversights.
* I understand that my work may have enormous effects on society and the economy, many of them beyond my comprehension.
